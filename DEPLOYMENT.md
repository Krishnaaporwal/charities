## Testing the Contract

### 1. Connect Wallet to Sepolia
Make sure your MetaMask is connected to Sepolia testnet.

### 2. Get Test ETH
Get free Sepolia ETH from faucets:
- https://sepoliafaucet.com
- https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia
- https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia

### 3. Test Campaign Creation
1. Go to `/create` on your platform
2. Fill in campaign details
3. Click "Create Campaign"
4. MetaMask will prompt for 0.01 SEP ETH platform fee
5. Confirm transaction
6. Wait for confirmation

### 4. Verify on Etherscan
After creating a campaign, check the transaction on:
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x5b19aE435CF4fA1DE595901380B7aA745C71afcb

## Frontend Integration

The contract address has been updated in:
```
client/src/lib/smartContract.ts
```

The frontend now:
- ✅ Connects to Sepolia testnet automatically
- ✅ Shows platform fee (0.01 SEP ETH) on campaign creation
- ✅ Displays testnet notice to users
- ✅ Links to faucets for getting test ETH
- ✅ Uses deployed contract address

---

## Cost Breakdown

### Creating a Campaign
- **Platform Fee**: 0.01 SEP ETH
- **Gas Fee**: ~0.002 - 0.005 SEP ETH (varies)
- **Total Cost**: ~0.012 - 0.015 SEP ETH

### Making a Donation
- **Donation Amount**: Your choice
- **Platform Fee**: None (only on campaign creation)
- **Gas Fee**: ~0.001 - 0.003 SEP ETH

---

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**:
- This is a TESTNET deployment
- Sepolia ETH has NO real value
- Never use mainnet private keys on testnet
- Platform fee is for demonstration only
- On mainnet, fees would be in real ETH

---

## Troubleshooting

### Contract not responding
- Check you're on Sepolia network
- Verify contract address is correct
- Check Etherscan for contract status

### Transaction failing
- Ensure sufficient SEP ETH for gas + platform fee
- Check if contract is already deployed at address
- Verify constructor parameters are correct

### MetaMask not showing Sepolia
- The platform auto-adds Sepolia network
- Manually add: Chain ID 11155111, RPC: https://rpc.sepolia.org

## Next Steps

### For Development
1. ✅ Contract deployed
2. ✅ Frontend updated with contract address
3. ✅ Testnet configuration complete
4. ⏳ Test full user flow
5. ⏳ Test donations and withdrawals
6. ⏳ Verify all events are emitted correctly

### For Production (Future)
1. Audit smart contract code
2. Get security review
3. Deploy to Ethereum mainnet
4. Update frontend to mainnet
5. Set up monitoring and alerts
